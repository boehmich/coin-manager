# Coin Manager App

## About
The app is intended to provide an overview of purchased cryptocoins.
On the home page the first 100 coins of the CoinmarketCap Api are loaded and displayed. 
By interweaving the swiperefresher, the app fetches the id, name, symbol, slug, percentage change of the last hour, day, week and the current value of the coins.
One can add each coin to a local watchlist. The purchase price and the date of purchase have to be entered. In the watchlist, the current values of the coins are loaded by activating the swiperefresher. Then the percentage change of the coins is calculated and displayed.
